## Do you even need a custom font?

Before you start reading this article, ask yourself if you actually need a custom font.
In the end, the fastest loaded font is the one that is not loaded at all.

In example bellow you can see how to pick all system fonts on different OSes.

```css
:root {
	font-family:
		system-ui,
		-apple-system,
		'Segoe UI',
		'Roboto',
		'Ubuntu',
		'Cantarell',
		'Noto Sans',
		sans-serif,
		'Apple Color Emoji',
		'Segoe UI Emoji',
		'Segoe UI Symbol',
		'Noto Color Emoji';
}
```

However, in most scenarios you simply don't have a choice, so let's get to it.

## Why should I optimize fonts?

Maybe you are just chasing 100/100 score in lighthouse, or you just can't use Google fonts, or you are just curious.
Optimizing your fonts can save you some bandwidth and by that make your page load a bit faster and that's what frontend devs are all about, right?

## How can I optimize my fonts then?

Here is a list for you:

- Try to use local font
- Use modern formats
- Don't load glyphs you don't need

### Try to use local font

All devices have some default fonts installed, for example if you are using Roboto, Android devices have it built in, so there is no need to download it again.
Use [`local()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/src#localfont-face-name) to try to use local font first and if it is not available, then download it.

```css
@font-face {
	font-family: 'Roboto';
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: 400;
	src:
		local('Roboto'),
		url('/fonts/roboto.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

### Use modern formats

These days you can safely use modern `.woff2` format and if you really care about that 0.1% of users that are still using IE, you can use `.woff` like so.

```css
@font-face {
	font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: 400;
	src:
		url('/fonts/comic-sans-ms.woff2') format('woff2'),
		url('/fonts/comic-sans-ms.woff') format('woff');
}
```

Make sure that `.woff2` is the first format in the list, because **_browsers will pick the first compatible format_**.

So even if you have your super tiny `.woff2` file, if it's not the first font in `src:` browser will download the first compatible font, or worse it will download `.eot` and then `.woff`. I am looking at you, Firefox.

### Don't load glyphs you don't need

#### Limiting glyph count

I am pretty sure your blog in English doesn't need Chinese or Japanese glyphs, so why load them? You can use [fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) or similar tool to remove glyphs you don't need.
Just make sure you don't remove any glyphs you actually need, like special characters or emojis. Also, make sure you are not modifying a licensed font.

In case you are dealing with a multilingual page, you can use fonttools to split your font into multiple files.
Use [`unicode-range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range) to load only glyph range you actually need.
This is more important for Asian languages where glyph count is much larger.
You can find Unicode ranges for different languages here [Unicode Character Charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts/).

```css
/* Limited Latin glyphs */
@font-face {
	font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: 400;
	src:
		local('Comic Sans MS'),
		url('/fonts/comic-sans-latin.woff2') format('woff2');
	unicode-range: U+0000-007F;
}

/* Chinese simplified glyphs */
@font-face {
	font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: 400;
	src:
		local('Comic Sans MS'),
		url('/fonts/comic-sans-zh.woff2') format('woff2');
	unicode-range: U+4E00-9FFF, U+3400-4DBF;
}
```

### Font weight and style

Are you asking yourself if you even need to load bold and italic glyphs?

I have just the thing for you! Browsers can synthesize their own bold and italic glyphs, so you don't need to load them!

However, this is far from perfect, so your mileage might vary. This is also different for each browser and OS, so make sure to check with your designer.
Another problem might be with languages where _italic_ forms are in different shape.

So if pixel perfect fonts are something you are looking for, you will need to download them.

## Final thoughts

If you need to use custom font, make sure you are using `.woff2` and if you have some spare time, remove glyphs you don't need or split them into separate files.

`.woff` is supported by IE9+ if you really need to support something older than that, then stop and get some help.

On a serious note, those users will appreciate if you stick to system fonts.
